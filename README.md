# blog-1

This is my first blog project!

I have created this website as a part of my Backend developing basics and I hosted this via Heroku.As till now, it is still under development and the stuff what we can do with it is : 1.Compose posts using Compose tab which will redirect u to homepage that it shows ur post and if its long it gets shortened out. 2.Then you can also use the name of the keyword of ur post in the url by adding ' /posts/'postname' ' and if it has spaces use '-' inbetween the words. 3.You can view all ur posts during the session in the homepage, but unfortunately it doesnt gets saved in a db. I will try to implement those stuff to in later updates! Till then!
